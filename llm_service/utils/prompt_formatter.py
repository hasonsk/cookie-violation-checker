Extraction guidelines:
For "is_specific": Determines if the website provides detailed descriptions of individual cookies:
- Set to 0 if cookies are only described generically (e.g., "performance cookies," "necessary cookies," "Google cookies") without specific explanations
- Set to 1 if cookies are described with specific names, purposes, retention periods, and third parties. Example: "The '_ga' cookie is used by Google Analytics to distinguish users and is stored for 2 years" would result in is_specific = 1

For the "cookies" list containing objects, each object has
- "cookie_name": Extract the exact technical name as mentioned. One object just has only one cookie name, Ã¬f more one, create multiple objects. For example: ga, _gid, _gat --> 3 object cookies
- "declared_purpose": cookie's purpose. With the following options:
  * Strictly Necessary: Essential for basic website functionality
  * Functionality: Personalizes user experience
  * Analytical: Collects usage data
  * Targeting/Advertising/Marketing: For personalized ads
  * Performance: Improves technical performance
  * Social Sharing: Enables social media integration
  * Null: When no specific purpose information is provided
- "declared_retention": Record the exact storage duration as mentioned
- "declared_third_parties": An list of third parties involved in the use of this cookie for website-owned cookies
- "declared_description": exact wording from the policy without modification or embellishment

EXTRACT detailed information about each cookie mentioned in that policy"""
